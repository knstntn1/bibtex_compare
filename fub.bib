  abstract  = { Quantum technologies are currently among the most promising technological developments, with quantum computing, in particular, playing a crucial role. This is accompanied by promising opportunities, but also new challenges for our society. However, quantum computing as a subject of computer science education is still at the very beginning. This paper aims to discuss quantum computing as a topic in computer science education and to make a first approach to central terms and ideas as well as their explanatory approaches. With the help of an explorative focus group interview with experts, five core ideas of quantum computer science are identified in this study. A literature review is then used to identify, categorize, and contrast different explanatory approaches for these ideas. The results thus contribute to making quantum computer science accessible for computing education and raise further questions for the computing education research community.},

 abstract = {Selbstständig Fehler in Programmcode zu finden und zu beheben stellt sowohl eine wichtige Fähigkeit als auch eine große Herausforderung beim Programmierenlernen dar. Debuggen unterscheidet sich von allgemeinen Programmierfertigkeiten und muss explizit gelehrt werden. Dennoch gibt es überraschend wenige Studien, Materialien und Konzepte, die sich mit der expliziten Vermittlung von Debuggingfähigkeiten beschäftigen. Eine relevante Debuggingfähigkeit ist ein systematisches Vorgehen bei der Fehlersuche. Dieser Beitrag analysiert die Wirksamkeit einer expliziten Vermittlung eines solchen systematischen Vorgehens im Unterricht, insbesondere hinsichtlich der Selbstwirksamkeitserwartungen und der resultierenden Debuggingleistung der Schülerinnen und Schüler. Zu diesem Zweck haben wir eine Intervention entwickelt, pilotiert und anschließend in einem Pre-Post-Kontrollgruppen-Test-Design untersucht. Die Ergebnisse zeigen sowohl einen signifikanten Anstieg der Selbstwirksamkeitserwartungen als auch der Debuggingleistung in der Versuchsgruppe.<br},

They also provide features such as version history or branching. However, block-based languages such as Snap! lack an adequate equivalent. In this demo, we present „smerge“, a tool that provides just that for Snap!. The application is web-based and focuses on intuitiveness and ease of use. It offers many advantages for educational settings by providing features such as automatic branching, visualization of the project and its history in a graph, integration into existing workflows, and easy merging. While targeted at novices, it offers great opportunities for complex Snap!-projects. Experience how smerge can unleash its full potential in your projects and educational settings!<br},

 abstract = {Self-reliance in debugging is both an important skill and a major challenge in learning to program. Debugging is distinct from general programming skills and needs to be taught explicitly. Nevertheless, when it comes to teaching and learning debugging, there are surprisingly few studies and results. The aim of this qualitative study is to investigate how students and teachers cope with errors in the K12 classroom, which debugging skills are conveyed, and why teachers teach or do not teach certain debugging skills. Therefore, in a first step, we identify skills considered relevant for debugging by applying desk research. We particularly focus on skills considered relevant for novices. Building upon this, we analyze 12 interviews of German high-school teachers using structured qualitative content analysis. The results show that especially weaker students are often helpless and apply a trial-and-error approach for coping with programming errors. It turns out that compile-time errors pose a big hurdle for many students. Teachers are mostly rushing from one student PC to the other, trying to help. Regarding the teaching of debugging skills, teachers focus on heuristics for common bugs as well as some debugging strategies. No systematic process on how to tackle and cope with errors is conveyed by teachers. Furthermore, they do not employ explicit teaching lessons on debugging. Overall, teachers lack a systematic approach for teaching debugging, as there are only insufficient concepts and materials.<br},

 abstract = {Debugging code is a central skill for students but also a considerable challenge when learning to program: helplessness and, in consequence, frustration when confronted with errors is a common phenomenon in the K12 classroom. Debugging is distinct from general programming abilities, therefore it should be taught explicitly. Despite this, debugging is an underrepresented topic in the classroom as well as in computer science education research, as only few studies, materials and concepts discuss the explicit teaching of debugging. Consequently, novices are often left on their own in developing debugging skills. This paper analyses the effectiveness of explicitly teaching a systematic debugging process, especially with regard to the students’ self-efficacy and the resulting debugging performance. To this end, we developed an intervention, piloted it and then examined it in a pre-post-control-group-test-design: Both experimental and control groups were surveyed using a questionnaire and given debugging exercises as a pre-test. Afterward, the intervention was carried out in the experimental group, while the control group continued to work on debugging exercises. During the post-test, the students once more worked on debugging exercises and were surveyed. The results show a significant increase in both self-efficacy expectations and debugging performance in the experimental group in contrast to the control group. Therefore, our study provides empirical arguments for explicitly teaching debugging and simultaneously offers a hands-on approach for the classroo},

We live in times of digital change, which manifests in the increasing pervasiveness of embedded and cyber-physical systems in our society. This change also needs to be reflected in education, as new knowledge and competencies become necessary to deal with everyday life challenges, for instance when estimating consequences of capturing, transmitting and evaluating sensor data in many devices and acting accordingly and responsibly. This article examines requirements that the digital society places on CS education. In our analysis, we identified numerous contexts, activities and knowledge areas relevant for students to cope with challenges of the digital world. Combined with content knowledge relevant in this domain, suitable phenomena and thus anchor points for teaching can be generated and, on this basis, specific learning scenarios can be developed that also consider general educative aims imposed by our society.},

	Abstract = {Physical computing covers the design and realization of interactive objects and instal-lations and allows students to develop concrete, tangible products of the real world, which arise from the learners' imagination. This can be used in computer science education to provide students with interesting and motivating access to the different topic areas of the subject in construction-ist and creative learning environments. To make many existing activities and examples of such project ideas available for classroom use and to expand the topic areas suitable for learning in such environments beyond introductory to programming, a physical computing syllabus for computer science courses in general education schools has been developed. In this paper the methods and different perspectives that were taken into account are presented. The resulting syllabus can be used to develop a constructionist computer science curriculum with physical computing.},
